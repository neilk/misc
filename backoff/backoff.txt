In the language of your choosing, write a console application called 'backoff' which 
runs another shell command repeatedly until it succeeds. If the command fails, it waits
a second before retying, then two seconds, and so on.

For example, imagine we run this command in a directory where there is no file named 'foo'.

  $ backoff cat foo
  sleeping 1 seconds before retry...
  sleeping 2 seconds before retry...
  sleeping 4 seconds before retry...
  sleeping 8 seconds before retry...

(at this point, we create the file 'foo' with contents "aha!", and a few seconds later...

  aha!

And then the program terminates.

I'm not sure what this directory was about!

I think I was trying to write a simple programming test for candidates, to show familiarity with

- Unix concepts like return values from shell, forking
- Handling errors
- Simple processing of data, escaping
- Time
- Basic programming

I find these to be more representative of what programmers actually do than fancy algorithm tests.
(Unix knowledge is specific to the operating systems I tend to use like MacOS and Linux. Your mileage may
vary.)

These programs have bugs! I can see that there are plenty of issues with them, particularly around
escaping and error handling. I wrote these to see how long it would take a competent candidate to complete 
the most basic version.

I suck at C, but my implementation seems to work.

Later I added JavaScript just for fun.
